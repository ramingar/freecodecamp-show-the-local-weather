WARNING: getCurrentPosition() and watchPosition() no longer work on insecure origins. To use this feature, it is necessary to switch the application to a secure origin, such as HTTPS. On the other hand, in case I serve my application through HTTPS, the free plan on OpenWeatherMap doesn't provide ssl, because of that it is impossible get the device's location on a mobile phone and this program doesn't work on that devices.
